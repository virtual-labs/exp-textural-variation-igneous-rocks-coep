        "a": "Explanation :The term texture is defined as the mutual relationship of different mineralogical constituents in a rock. It is determined by the size, shape and arrangement of these constituents within the body of the rock.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Explanation : Poikilitic texture is characterized with the presence of fine-grained crystals within the body of large sized crystals. In other words, it is just the reverse of the porphyritic textures.",
